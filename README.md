# Caesar Hacker

# How to Use

To use the Caesar Hacker program, simply input your encrypted message into the program.

When you enter, every key is run through the message until the max number of shifts possible are done. After you are done running, you will be able to go through the keys printed out, and be able to find the key that maps to a message that makes the most sense to you.

Enjoy Caesar Hacker!
